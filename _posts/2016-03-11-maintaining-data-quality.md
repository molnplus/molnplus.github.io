## Background
對於任何基於數據的商業來說，數據質量都是至關重要的。

## A Story

Recently, a friend had a dissatisfying experience with a timeshare resort that she uses for her vacations often. 
When she booked a vacation with one of their properties, the company would send a confirmation text message to her but would send the confirmation email message to her father who was a co-owner of the timeshare. 
She and her father spent a cumulative of one hour across many days, many phone calls and many emails to understand and deal with the problem. 
“Why should my father have to get an email when I’m going on a vacation with my husband?” 
was her grouse. 
The timeshare company’s customer care executives blamed the IT system. 
But at the end of it, it turned out that incorrect training had led to employees not really understanding the difference between ‘co-owner email address’ and ‘alternate email address’.

“If this is how it is,” my friend complained to me, “I’m unsubscribing from this timeshare.”

This is how bad data quality (in this case, cause due to incorrect training) leads to bad customer experiences.

I call it the Data Quality Axiom.

### Data Quality ∝ Customer Experience

Bad data quality does not have to be an employee’s fault, though. 
Customers can be the ‘culprits’ too. 
In 2013, The United States Postal Service estimated that it could not deliver approximately 6.8 billion pieces of mail as addressed. 
In fact, Gartner research today indicates that poor data quality is costing organizations an average of $8.8 million per annum. 
Gartner also forecasts that by 2017, a third of the largest global corporations will face an information crisis due to their inability to adequately value, govern and trust their enterprise information.

Data quality doesn’t just stem from input errors. 
Take a look at this chart thrown up by a popular fitness app for another of my friends.
