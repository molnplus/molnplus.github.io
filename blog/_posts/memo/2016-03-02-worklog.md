clone from Github becomes a problem again。
Perhaps it is due to I changed id_rsa in '~/.ssh'.

in university, i was trying to build a method to analyse and predict the structure of protein, but i did not make it happen;
then, i wanted to find a way to produce or clone plants, it failed again;
now, i am trying to analyse and predict data, it is in trouble.
all i want is one thing, the method.

i should keep on going, and focus on one thing at a time.
methods to services, and then, to products is a standard proceed.
and it will bring money or wealth to me.

nothing is impossible.

專注於一個項目是比較困難的。
因為隨時會有不同的干擾，例如，喝水、上廁所、處理同事或者家人的事務等等。
思路也不可能一直保持在高度集中的狀態。
那麼，我曾經嘗試過蕃茄鐘，但是沒有堅持下來。

在自己身上找原因是關鍵的事情！
不改變就不會有改善。
